Description: This package receives an input data-frame and mutates
  the contents of it's cells based on the rules presented in a 2nd data-frame.
  The 'rules' consist
  of a set of regex match patterns for the columns
  in the first data-frame. If the row matches a rule
  then the functions represented in the appended
  columns are executed and the results included in the
  cells provided.
